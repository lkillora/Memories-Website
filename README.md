# memories-website
I created a website that allowed users of the website to maintain collective memories by uploading stories in the form of text as well as images and and videos for specific entries of the memory list. They could also add, edit, and delete memories.

To run this on your local machine you could use XAMPP and MySQL. Put these files in the htdocs folder of the XAMPP program files folder. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and run the Apache server as well as MySQL (and ensure is not already running on the port that was supposed to be used). Click on the "Admin" button in the XAMPP Control Panel for MySQL to open PHPMyAdmin. From here, import the initialise_tables.sql files to initialise the database and tables. Then click on the "Admin" button in the XAMPP Control Panel for the Apache server to open the site and enjoy.
